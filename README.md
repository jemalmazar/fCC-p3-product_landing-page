### Project Epilogue

I couldn't decide on a specific product to build this project around so I decided to build in around placeholder since I would be using *Lorem Ipsum* text throughout the page.

Another simple and straightforward page to build. After reading some deisgn articles, I incorporated some small design touches in attempt to give a simple page some more life. This included a border at the top of the nav bar, multi-colour gradient hero, call-to-action form overlapping into the hero, and SVG icon use.

Overall, the project built upon what I've learned about HTML and CSS while introducing SVG into the mix.
